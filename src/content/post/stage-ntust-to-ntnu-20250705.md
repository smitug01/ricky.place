**A Journey of Courage: From NTUST to NTNU**

So today's a pretty big day for me. After months of going back and forth in my head, I finally submitted my leave of absence from Taiwan Tech (NTUST). It's weird - I'm not just thinking about change anymore, I'm actually doing it. Starting today, I'm officially switching from being a Taiwan Tech student to an NTNU student. No more joking around with "天大地大台科大，台清交成在腳下" with my classmates (though I'll definitely miss those moments).

### How It All Started

Honestly, I've been feeling this way for a while now. Even during my first year at Taiwan Tech, when everything was new and exciting, something just felt... off. Electronic Engineering is a solid major with great job prospects, but it wasn't doing it for me. I kept finding myself way more interested in Computer Science and Information Engineering - that's where things actually clicked and made sense.

The thing is, when I applied through Special Entry back then, my options were pretty limited based on my background. Electronic Engineering at Taiwan Tech was basically the best fit available at the time. Don't get me wrong - Taiwan Tech is a great school with a solid reputation, but it felt like wearing someone else's clothes. Nice clothes, but not really me.

I kept up a decent GPA around 3.7 during my first year, but I noticed I was just going through the motions in my core engineering classes. The material was interesting enough, but it didn't give me that spark I was looking for.

### Looking for a Way Out

Instead of just accepting things as they were, I started researching other options. I looked into transferring within Taiwan Tech, checked out inter-university transfers, and even thought about applying through Special Entry again - this time knowing exactly what I wanted.

The cool thing about Special Entry is that it's pretty flexible. If I got in somewhere else, great. If not, I could just continue where I was without any penalties. Plus, they announce results early, so I'd have plenty of time to figure things out.

When I started seriously looking at other schools, NYCU and NTHU caught my eye. But NTNU made the most sense for a few reasons. First, I could stay in Taipei and wouldn't have to move away from Keelung. Also, there's this interesting setup where Taiwan Tech and NTNU students can cross-register for classes, which could open up some cool possibilities later.

### The Big News

In early January 2025, the results came in. I got accepted into NTNU's Computer Science and Information Engineering department with a perfect 100 on the document review. To be honest, I wasn't that shocked. After working in the field for a year, I had way more experience and confidence than when I first applied to universities.

But getting accepted was just the beginning. Standing at this crossroads, I felt pretty overwhelmed. Should I leave Taiwan Tech where I'd made friends, gotten comfortable, and found my place? Starting over - academically, socially, personally - was both exciting and terrifying.

## The Reality Check

The numbers were kind of intimidating: about 25% of my graduating class from Da'an Vocational High School ended up at Taiwan Tech, so I had this built-in network of familiar faces. At NTNU, I'd basically know nobody. That meant starting from scratch with making friends, learning new systems, and adapting to a completely different vibe.

And then there's the academic side - I'd essentially be starting university over, which means graduating at least a year later than my current classmates. That's a pretty big deal when you think about career timing and life plans.

## The Push I Needed

During all this back-and-forth, my colleague Lumi really helped me see things clearly. She basically told me that staying somewhere just because it's comfortable or expected is actually the riskier move in the long run. Her support gave me the push I needed to prioritize what would actually make me happy over what was just convenient.

With her encouragement, I started seeing this transition differently. Instead of abandoning what I'd built, I was finally going after what I actually wanted. The decision became clear: I'd step out of my comfort zone and follow my passion for Computer Science, trusting that the temporary discomfort would be worth it.

## Taking the Leap

Today, as I officially start at National Taiwan Normal University, I'm feeling a mix of excitement, nervousness, and hope. This isn't just about changing schools or majors - it's about committing to figuring out who I really am and having the guts to pursue what actually inspires me, even when the path ahead is unclear.

I have no idea what's going to happen next, and I can't predict if this choice will lead exactly where I'm hoping. There's even a part of me wondering if I might come back to Taiwan Tech someday to do a dual bachelor's degree, getting the best of both worlds. But what I do know is that I'm done wondering "what if." I'm ready to find out "what is" and "what could be."

Growth doesn't happen when you're comfortable. Sometimes the most meaningful journeys start with the courage to leave what's familiar and head toward something that feels right, even when you can't see the whole picture yet.

Here's to new beginnings, following passion over convenience, and the beautiful uncertainty of a future shaped by authentic choices rather than just settling. My move from Taiwan Tech to NTNU isn't just about changing universities - it's about changing my life's direction toward something that actually feels like me.

Maybe I'll come back to finish my bachelor's degree in electronic engineering. Ha. Goodbye NTUST!
